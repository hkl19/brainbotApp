- intent: inform_course_structure
  examples: |
    - I think the course overall was rushed through too quickly, with too little focus on the details
    - I think the lecturer really did an awesome job entertaining us all the way
    - I found it really engaging and overall super exciting
    - It was rather dull and not exciting. I felt really let down
    - I didnt like it one bit, the structure was a mess.
    - I loved how fast paced the flow is on the lectures, as well as the tutorial sessions
    - I felt really listened to by the lecturer as he gave personal tutorials with so much effort
    - The lecturer really attended to all our needs, and the module enthusiasm reflects that
    - I felt that this module was one of the toughest one, too hard for a third year student
    - I think the lectures were really engaging and well taught
    - I really enjoyed the constant feedback for improvements, it helped me alot along the year
    - boring
    - really interesting
    - awesome
    - love it
    - amazing
    - uninformative
    - its bad
    - Really good lecturing and an interesting engineering challenge
    - Teach in very complicated way
    - The lecturer explains concepts very well. The module feels well structured. It does not feel like it's going too fast.
    - Mediocre, could be better
    - He's not great. Good tutorials but meh lectures/notes
    - Very enthusiastic although the module feels not very planned
    - Extremely passionate and good
    - It's bare long not gonna lie
    - Lecture notes created in LaTex are such a turn on
    - Very interesting stuff but can be a bit confusing
    - Really like the course and the topics discussed
    - too much troubleshooting than actual learning, takes up more than 80% of the coding time
    - Lousy
    - I think they should continue the module and have a statistics 2 module as it would be helpful to learn more about it
    - Could be better. I did not take Primary School mathematics so I did not understand half of the mode. The other half of the module looks cool. Lecturer could be better, wish I had quit university this year to work on my business though.
    - I think that the course was well done, but work load was significantly stressful
