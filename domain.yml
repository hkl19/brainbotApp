  - text: Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a handsome ogre called Shrek. Shrek lived alone in the forest, without a friend. He loved to swim in swamps. His favourite pass time is eating babies (baby mushrooms), who all screamed in terror as his mouth devoured them one by one. He was a happy ogre.
